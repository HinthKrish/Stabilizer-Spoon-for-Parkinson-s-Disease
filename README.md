# Stabilizer-Spoon-for-Parkinson-s-Disease
Objective
To enhance the quality of life for individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease by enabling them to eat independently using a smart spoon that compensates for involuntary hand movements.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Active stabilization to counteract hand tremors.
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for tremor detection.
Motorized compensation mechanism for spoon movement.
Lightweight and ergonomically designed handle.
Rechargeable battery with long-lasting performance.

ðŸ§  Components Used:
Microcontroller (Arduino Nano / ESP32).
MPU6050 (Gyroscope + Accelerometer) sensor.
Servo motors for real-time stabilization.
Li-ion battery with charging module.
3D-printed or custom-designed spoon mount.

ðŸ“Œ Applications:
Assistive eating for Parkinsonâ€™s and tremor patients.
Daily-use rehabilitation devices.
Health tech innovation and R&D.
Prototype for medical device development.
